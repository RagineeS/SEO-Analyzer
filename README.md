### How It Works
Users input or paste their content into a text area on the webpage.

When the "Analyze SEO" button is clicked or Ctrl+Enter is pressed, the frontend sends the content to the backend via a POST request.

The server processes the text and returns:

Word count

Sentence count

Estimated reading time

Readability score and reading level

Suggested SEO keywords

SEO tips to improve content quality

Users can insert suggested keywords directly into the text from the interface.

### Testing and Edge Case Handling
Validates empty input and shows an alert to the user.

Prevents repeated keyword insertion by tracking inserted keywords.

Updates keyword status after insertion to reflect current content.

Displays a loading indicator while analysis is in progress.

Responsive UI with appropriate error handling on the frontend and backend.
